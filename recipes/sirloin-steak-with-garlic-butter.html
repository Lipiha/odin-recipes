    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This sirloin steak recipe is served with very garlicky butter that makes this steak melt-in-your-mouth wonderful! I have never tasted any other steak that came even close to this recipe. If you are having steak, don't skimp on flavor to save a few calories.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Â½ cup butter</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>4 pounds beef top sirloin steaks</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</p></li>
        <li><p>Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat; stir in minced garlic and garlic powder. Set aside.</p></li>
        <li><p>Season both sides of each steak with salt and pepper.</p></li>
        <li><p>Place steaks on preheated grill and cook 4 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C) for medium doneness.</p></li>
        <li><p>Transfer steaks to warmed plates; brush the tops liberally with garlic butter and allow to rest for 2 to 3 minutes before serving.</p></li>
    </ol>
